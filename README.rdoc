= Lolita Menu
Create, sort and publish menus with Lolita.

==Instalation
In your project Gemfile put
  gem 'lolita-menu'
And run
  bundle install
Like with other Lolita gems call
  rails g lolita_menu:install
Since this gem comes with migrations
  rake db:migrate 
=== Using autocomplete
To use autocomplete you need to add all possible url's in config/lolita-menu-urls.rb (follow instructions in file)
After that you can popuate all from file in result file by execucuting
  rake lolita_menu:generate
If you want to add url when some of objects are created, then in your model add after_save or after_create callbacks and in related method add
  Lolita::Menu::Urls.add("/link", "Label"), unfortuneately it's impossible to use routes helper methods unless you do your own workaround.
Enjoy!
